# INTECAL-Hello-World
It's a repo for the INTERCAL code for Hello World
## What is INTERCAL?  
It is a mind-blowing language that makes you question your sanity! Don't take my world for it, ask the creator(s) of INTERCAL  
## Why INTERCAL?  
Well, this project was supposed to be my submission to the daily challenge at GHW January and I thought to myself, "Why not make things extremely hard for myself?" and I created this project using INTERCAL  
## Would I reccomend INTERCAL?  
If you have a whole lotta time to kill and huge amounts of patience go for it. Otherwise, run away as fast as you can!  
## Can I use this code?  
Please, feel free to use this code however you see fit!
